          <p>The UHS Speech and Debate team will occasionally hold one-day seminars.
          We will be teaching fundamental public speaking skills, such as articulation, communication, and confidence. By the end of the workshop, students will have
          a better understanding of how to express their ideas fluently and clearly, and will have practiced the basics of oration.</p>
