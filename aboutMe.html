          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p id="about">My name is Noelle Lambert, and I am a junior at Unionville High School. I have been featured in Randall Stutman’s book about parenting as an illustrator, and I am involved in many clubs and activities at my school. But more importantly, I love architecture. I created this website to express my growing interest in design and art. Although I enjoy all types of art and architecture, I am particularly interested in the modern style of design. As I build my portfolio, I hope to showcase my photography and art in all of the mediums I use, including acrylics, graphite, charcoal and watercolor. Overall, my goal with this website is to expand my community’s interest in art in any way I can.</p>
